                    JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                    first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                    non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript
                    is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
                    imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

                    Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                    emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well
                    as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                    large-scale projects.

                    Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is
                    often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                    few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
                    to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                    all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are
                    typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the
                    underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
                    low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as
                    reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled
                    languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
                    GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million
                    developers.

                    PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally
                    created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[8] The PHP reference implementation is
                    now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands
                    for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
